## Welcome to the Sora Full-Stack Coding Challenge!

If you wish to work at Sora, follow the instructions below!

### Challenge Description

At Sora, each of our students have skills that are rated on a scale from level 0-4 based on their demonstrated knowledge. This is our replacement for "grades". In this scenario, a student has a question about a specific skill. So, create a web app using React and Express that helps the student find the correct person to answer their question about a selected skill.

Selection logic: A question should go to a student who is a level 3 or 4 in the skill. If there are two or more students who meet those level requirements, prioritize students in the same house then prioritize higher level, in that order. However, ensure the selected student is always at least one level higher than the student. If no student is a level 3 or 4 and is not at least one level higher, it will be directed to the Faculty member who has a tag for the skill's subject.

### Example Outputs

_assuming you're the 'Tester' student_

- skill_id === 1 => Faculty member 'Carolyn Reeves'
- skill_id === 3 => Student 'Ludwig Wittgenstein'
- skill_id === 4 => Faculty member 'Michael Granado'
- skill_id === 6 => Student 'Max Stirner'

### Judging Criteria

We'll be examining the app's logic as well as its design and user experience. We expect the app to be reactive to different screen sizes. Imagine that your small app is going to production tommorrow! Although it's outside of the scope of this challenge, expect further questions about potential database desing.

### Getting Started

To run the app:

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Fireup the database:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Run express server:

```bash
cd server/ && yarn start
```

Run react app:

```bash
cd client && yarn start
```
